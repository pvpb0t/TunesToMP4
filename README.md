# TunesToMP4 - A Free and Safe Alternative to TunesToTube

TunesToMP4 is a simple and safe Python-based tool that allows you to create videos with a still image and an audio track. Unlike TunesToTube, this tool can be self-hosted, runs on your own computer, and is completely free, ensuring your data privacy and security.

## Features

- Combine an image and an audio file (MP3/WAV) into a single video file (MP4).
- Maintain the aspect ratio of the image or stretch it to fit the output resolution.
- Add a customizable watermark to the output video.
- Easy-to-use GUI for selecting image, audio, and output options.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or newer
- MoviePy
- Pillow (PIL)

### Installation

```

2. Install the required packages:

### Usage

1. Run the GUI-based desktop application:
